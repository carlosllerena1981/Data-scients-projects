''''6.11 LAB: Creating SLR models
The nbaallelo_slr.csv dataset contains information on 126315 NBA games between 1947 and 2015. The columns report the points made by one team, the Elo rating of that team coming into the game, the Elo rating of the team after the game, and the points made by the opposing team.

Load the data set into a data frame.
Create a new column y in the data frame that is the difference between the points made by the two teams.
Use the ols function to perform a simple linear regression on the y and elo_i columns.
Create an analysis of variance table using the results of the SLR.
Ex: If the Elo rating of the team after the game, elo_n, is used instead of elo_i, the output is:

                sum_sq        df             F  PR(>F)
elo_n     2.498800e+06       1.0  15705.983944     0.0
Residual  2.009606e+07  126312.0           NaN     NaN '''

# Import the necessary modules
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.formula.api as sms
import statsmodels.api as sm # For anova table function
nba = pd.read_csv("nbaallelo_slr.csv") # Code to read in nbaallelo_slr.csv

# Create a new column in the data frame that is the difference between pts and opp_pts
nba['y'] = nba.pts - nba.opp_pts # Code to find the difference between the columns pts and opp_pts

# Perform simple linear regression on y and elo_i
results = sms.ols('y ~ elo_i', data = nba).fit() # Code to perform SLR using statsmodels ols 

# Create an analysis of variance table
aov_table = sm.stats.anova_lm(results, typ=2) # Code to create ANOVA table

# Print the analysis of variance table
print(aov_table)
